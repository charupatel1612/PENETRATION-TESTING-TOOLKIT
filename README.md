# PENETRATION-TESTING-TOOLKIT

**COMPANY:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**NAME:** PATEL CHARU MUKESHBHAI  
**INTERN ID:** CITSOD254  
**DOMAIN:** CYBERSECURITY – PYTHON BASED PROJECT  
**DURATION:** 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR:** NEELA SANTOSH

## 📄 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a **Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit** built using **IDEL**. It simulates basic tasks like **port scanning** and **brute-force attacks** to help understand how attackers probe systems. It supports ethical hacking and network security learning.

Each tool runs individually based on the user’s selection from a simple menu.

---

## 🔧 FEATURES

- **Port Scanner:**
  - Scans a target IP for open ports in a specified range.

- **Brute Force Simulator:**
  - Takes a username and a password list (`password.txt`).
  - Simulates login attempts and finds valid matches.

- **Modular Design:**
  - Organized into separate scripts.
  - Easy to expand with more tools.

---

## 🧑‍💻 TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Python 3.9+
- socket, time, os, sys
- IDEL (Python IDE)

---

## 🧪 HOW TO PERFORM THIS PRACTICAL

Follow these steps to perform the practical:

1. **Create a project folder** (e.g., `Q_3`) on your desktop or any location.

2. **Place the following files inside the folder:**
   - `main_toolkit.py`
   - `port_scanner_module.py`
   - `brute_forcer_module.py`
   - `password.txt` (contains a list of sample passwords)

3. **Open the `main_toolkit.py` file** using IDEL (Python's integrated development environment).

4. **Run the script** by pressing `F5` or selecting `Run > Run Module` from the IDEL menu.

5. **When prompted, you will see a menu:**
     1. Port Scanner
     2. Brute Force
     3. Exit

7. **To scan ports:**
- Choose Option 1
- Enter the target IP address (e.g., 104.22.27.77)
- Enter the starting and ending port numbers (e.g., 0 to 50)
- The tool will scan and display any open ports found

7. **To perform a brute-force simulation:**
- Choose Option 2
- Enter a username (e.g., jiya)
- The tool will try passwords from `password.txt`
- If a correct password is found, it will be shown

## 📚 LEARNING OUTCOMES

- Learned basic port scanning and brute force techniques
- Applied simple attack simulations using Python
- Gained hands-on experience in ethical hacking

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

This toolkit enhanced my practical skills in ethical hacking. It builds a strong base in penetration testing and Python automation for security tasks.
